**Dirac Live Active Room Treatment (ART) FAQ**

**What is Dirac Live Active Room Treatment (ART)?**

Active Room Treatment is a cutting-edge addition to Dirac Live that uses your existing speakers as a unified system to control room resonances and significantly enhance bass clarity. ART offers performance that was previously only possible through extensive physical treatment.

**What are the key benefits of ART?**

Key benefits of ART include reduced room resonance and reverberation, tighter and cleaner bass response with reduced decay time, a larger bass response sweet spot, and enhanced seat-to-seat consistency.

**How does ART work?**

ART utilises patented MIMO technology to coordinate all speakers, optimising their interaction to manage room-induced resonances, particularly in the critical 20-150 Hz bass frequency range.

**What is MIMO technology?**

MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) is a technology that coordinates all speakers and the room as a unified acoustic system, sharing optimisation and playback data among speakers for optimal results.

**Who is ART for?**

ART is most useful for audio enthusiasts, home cinema aficionados, and professional audio engineers who seek the next generation of room correction and complete control over their sound experience.

**How does ART differ from passive room treatment?**

Unlike passive acoustic treatments like bass traps or diffusers, ART actively uses existing speakers to minimise room-induced resonances. This enables sophisticated control of the sound field that traditional treatments cannot practically achieve at very low frequencies.

**What kind of room is ideal for ART?**

ART performs optimally in rooms ranging from approximately 12 m² to 100 m² (130 ft² to 1100 ft²), including typical home environments, home cinemas, and studio control rooms.

**What are the requirements for using ART?**

You need an ART-certified AVR or stereo receiver, a Dirac Live license with the ART add-on, the Dirac Live application on a Windows PC or Mac, and an omnidirectional measurement microphone. If using subwoofers, a Bass Control license is also required.

**What is the minimum speaker setup for ART?**

The minimum configuration required to see improvements with ART is a stereo system with two speakers.

**What is the frequency range of ART?**

ART specifically operates within the frequency range of 20 Hz to 150 Hz.

**Does ART replace Bass Control?**

No. Bass Control’s primary goal is automating subwoofer setup and supporting bass blending in the listening area. ART, however, actively creates an ideal sound field by coordinating all available speakers.

**Do I need to remeasure my system once I’ve activated ART?**

If the system was measured by following the Dirac guidelines*, and all measurement positions are validated, then it should not be necessary to remeasure. If the system configuration has changed by adding or removing speakers, then it is needed to remeasure.

**Does RC also improve the sweet spot, or is it only a feature for BC and ART? Is the sweet spot's frequency range or effectiveness different between RC, BC, and ART?**

Yes, RC improves performance within the measured area with a goal to meet the target response on average, meaning that a given one-point measurement (post-calibration) might show slight deviation from the target curve. ART, owing to its control of the sound field using all speakers, has significantly stronger performance in reducing spatial variation and accurately reproducing the target curve at any given measured position.

**Does RC have the flexible subwoofer placement feature? What is the difference between RC, BC, and ART regarding the flexible subwoofer placement feature?**

RC corrects subwoofers’ responses individually in both frequency and time domains, as well as applies delays to align them with mains. However, it does no dedicated calculations for bass management and control (as with BC) or active control of the subwoofers’ contribution to the target sound field (as with ART).
